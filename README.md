| **Starting Game** | Start the game by rolling the dice.                                                                                                                    |
| **Choosing**      | Decide whether to hold your current score or roll the dice again to increase it.                                                                       |
| **If You Get 1**  | Rolling a `1` will reset your current score to `0`, and the turn will switch to the other player.                                                      |
